Display a message saying that a lom is valid.
Include test files in svn and Valid lom file too.  Document all this.
Implement an associative array with error identifiers and error metadata (like referential page, etc.)
When validating the file 1.2_Titre/E1_Titre.xml, I get an error message with {0} marks.  These marks should be subsituted.  Why not?  The strings are in etc directory.
Make the references to demo.licef.ca parameterizable and document it in the manual.txt.
If we have this xml: <lom/>, we get the error: cvc-elt.1: Cannot find the declaration of element 'lom'. [1,6].  Could this be improved?  How to detect the absence of namespace and signal it in a user-friendly way.  <lom xmlns="http://ltsc.ieee.org/xsd/LOM"/> is better even though other rules are triggered for this too simple lom.
Clean the tests.  Ideally, there should be only one issue for each test.
Check the case when a file in the control file doesn't exist.
Check the case when a folder in the control file doesn't exist.
Refactor ValidationReport.toString() if needed.
Localize the validation status.
