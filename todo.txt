Just for info:  There are 316 validation rules in the xls file.
When validating the file 1.2_Titre/E1_Titre.xml, I get an error message with {0} marks.  These marks should be subsituted.  Why not?  The strings are in etc directory.
Localized as many strings as possible.
The online validator displays XSD errors in English.  Why so?
Make the report locale-sensitive.
Implement an associative array with error identifiers and error metadata (like referential page, etc.)
Make the references to demo.licef.ca parameterizable and document it in the manual.txt.
Check the case when a file in the control file doesn't exist.
Check the case when a folder in the control file doesn't exist.
Refactor ValidationReport.toString() if needed.
If we have this xml: <lom/>, we get the error: cvc-elt.1: Cannot find the declaration of element 'lom'. [1,6].  Could this be improved?  How to detect the absence of namespace and signal it in a user-friendly way.  <lom xmlns="http://ltsc.ieee.org/xsd/LOM"/> is better even though other rules are triggered for this too simple lom.
