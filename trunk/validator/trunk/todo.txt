Try to handle vocab errors and empty tag errors at the XSD level.  
Search for all messages of this pattern .*=.*|.* (with just one pipe...  We need at least 2 pipes).
All message keys must be of this format .*-5.3_.* otherwise the help reference won't be shown.
Display a message saying that a lom is valid.
Include test files in svn and Valid lom file too.  Document all this.
Implement an associative array with error identifiers and error metadata (like referential page, etc.)
There are some hardcoded references inside/to xsd files to localhost:8080/NormeticValidator.  Could it be possible to have a parameter instead.  It's not as easy as it seems.
If we have this xml: <lom/>, we get the error: cvc-elt.1: Cannot find the declaration of element 'lom'. [1,6].  Could this be improved?  How to detect the absence of namespace and signal it in a user-friendly way.  <lom xmlns="http://ltsc.ieee.org/xsd/LOM"/> is better even though other rules are triggered for this too simple lom.
Clean the tests.  Ideally, there should be only one issue for each test.
Check the case when a file in the control file doesn't exist.
Check the case when a folder in the control file doesn't exist.
Refactor ValidationReport.toString() if needed.
Localize the validation status.
