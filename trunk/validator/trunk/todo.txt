Comment out all P2 and E2 prefixed rules that are now implemented in XSDValidator.
Improve language validation.  For now, the XSD phase will detect very obvious errors (like a value of 'asdlfjadfojaeriofa').  Using Schematron (maybe duplicate or generate rules if required) to check valid values.
Display a message saying that a lom is valid.
Include test files in svn and Valid lom file too.  Document all this.
Implement an associative array with error identifiers and error metadata (like referential page, etc.)
There are some hardcoded references inside/to xsd files to localhost:8080/NormeticValidator.  Could it be possible to have a parameter instead.  It's not as easy as it seems.
Check the case when a file in the control file doesn't exist.
Check the case when a folder in the control file doesn't exist.
Refactor ValidationReport.toString() if needed.
Localize the validation status.
