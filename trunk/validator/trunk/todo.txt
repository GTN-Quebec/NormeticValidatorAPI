If we have this xml: <lom/>, we get the error: cvc-elt.1: Cannot find the declaration of element 'lom'. [1,6].  Could this be improved?  How to detect the absence of namespace and signal it in a user-friendly way.  <lom xmlns="http://ltsc.ieee.org/xsd/LOM"/> is better even though other rules are triggered for this too simple lom.
